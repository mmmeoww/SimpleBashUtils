Why Should We Learn C?
Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from the C language like the syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages that are mainly based on the C language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language (Only a few programs may compile in C, but not in C++).

So,  if a person learns C programming first, it will help them to learn any modern programming language as well. Also, learning C helps to understand a lot of the underlying architecture of the operating system like pointers, working with memory locations, etc.
